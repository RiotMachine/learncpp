/*
Explicit type conversion explicitly converts one data type to another
whereas implicit type conversion does this implicitly.

/* Alex's Answer
Implicit type conversion is automatically performed whenever one data type is expected, 
but a different data type is supplied.
Explicit type conversion happens when the programmer uses a type cast 
to explicitly convert a value from one type to another type.
