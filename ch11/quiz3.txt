The program outputs 
1
2
1
2
because two instantiations of int count(T) are created -
	one with type int and one with type double.
Each instantiation gets its own static int.

Correction:
originally wrote
0
1
0
1
but these are the values of static int c each time 
	count<int>(int)/count<double>(double) is called. 
	since ++c is returned cout prints 1 2 1 2


n.b.
prefix increment operator increments then returns incremented val
posfix increment copies init val, increments the underlying var, then
	returns init val 
*prefix* increment is the one that is preferred
postfix would have printed
0
1
0
1
since the 'preincrement' val is returned even though the static variable
	is incremented
