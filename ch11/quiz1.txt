a) Prints "int 5" since overloads prefer numeric promotion over conversion
b) Wont compile because print() is an ambiguous match with
	void print() and void print(int x=0)
c) Wont compile because print(5) is an ambiguous match with void print(long x)
	and void print (double x) -- int to long is considered a conversion
	so both options are considered conversions
